                YG Entertainment is aiming for the world. Through the joint venture with the top Japanese entertainment company AVEX in 2011, after already advancing into the Japanese market in 2007 by establishing YG Japan, YG was able to establish the solo label YGEX in an effort to more aggressively advance in the Japanese market. Once establishing their YG Asia headquarters in Hong Kong, YG was able to widen their influence to the larger mainland China and Taiwan. Through targeting the pop market's natives of the United States and Europe, tangible results can be envisioned by using a differentiated approach.
